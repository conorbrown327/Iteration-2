* \section observer_pattern Observer Pattern Discussion
* The observer pattern was used to allow the simulations entities to notify observers in
* the delivery simulation of changes in the state of the entity. For example, when the
* drone delivers a package and stops moving it will notify the observers of this change.
* This notification is printed in a UI on the simulations left hand side. The observer
* pattern was useful because it is dynamic and allows for new observers to be added and
* removed easily.
